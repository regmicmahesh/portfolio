    <h3>Python</h3>
    <p>
      I can do full-stack web development projects in python. I am also
      practicing data science, and machine learning with python. I have
      experience with FastAPI, Flask and Django. I am exploring data science
      with pandas, matplotlib and studying machine learning, planning to migrate
      on golang with backend and continue data science on python.
    </p>
    <h3>Javascript</h3>
    <p>
      I have worked a lot with javascript. I can design professional looking
      web- designs using React, planning to migrate to Vue. I've also worked
      with NodeJS, but I don't feel fun doing NodeJS projects a lot, as I hate
      javascript's package management and configuration style. I've worked with
      ExpressJS, MongoDB and Prisma , but I'm Adonis kind of guy.
    </p>
    <h3>Golang</h3>
    <p>
      I've been trying to learn golang lately, and trying to make some backend
      projects and enjoying the clean and fast coding in python. I've been
      trying to read some books and started to learn web-development, as I got
      inspired by @rwxrob. Pretty neatly, after some weeks, I'll be writing some
      interpreters in golang, as I got a book on it.
